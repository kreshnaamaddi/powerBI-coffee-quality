CQI-Coffee-Quality-Analysis: This project analyzes coffee quality factors using CQI data, exploring sensory attributes, processing methods, and defect impacts through Power BI visualizations.




üìå Understanding Coffee Quality through Data Analysis
üîπ Objective:
	‚Ä¢ Analyze coffee quality factors using given dataset.
	‚Ä¢ Identify key sensory attributes affecting coffee quality.
	‚Ä¢ Explore relationships between processing methods, regions, and quality scores.
	‚Ä¢ Examine the impact of defects on overall quality.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Determinants of Coffee Quality
‚úÖ Sensory attributes (Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Body, Balance, etc.) play a crucial role in determining coffee quality.
‚úÖ Top contributing factors (based on correlation analysis):
	‚Ä¢ Aroma & Flavor have the highest correlation with Total Cup Points.
	‚Ä¢ Balance & Acidity significantly influence perceived quality.
	‚Ä¢ Uniformity & Clean Cup ensure consistency in quality assessment.
‚úÖ Visualization Used:
	‚Ä¢ Heatmap to show attribute correlations.
	‚Ä¢ Bar Chart to compare top sensory attributes affecting Total Cup Points.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation between Processing Methods, Origin, and Quality Scores
‚úÖ Processing Methods Matter:
	‚Ä¢ Washed (Wet Processing) tends to have higher scores than Natural (Dry Processing).
	‚Ä¢ Honey Processed coffee falls in between.
‚úÖ Regional Influence:
	‚Ä¢ Countries like Ethiopia, Colombia, and Kenya have higher quality scores.
	‚Ä¢ Climate, soil, and altitude contribute to these differences.
‚úÖ Visualization Used:
	‚Ä¢ Boxplot comparing Processing Methods vs. Quality Score.
	‚Ä¢ Map Chart to visualize Average Quality Score by Country.
	‚Ä¢ Clustered Bar Chart showing Processing Method Distribution across Regions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Defects and Their Impact on Coffee Quality
‚úÖ Category One Defects (Black Beans, Insect Damage) lead to a major drop in quality scores.
‚úÖ Category Two Defects (Over-fermentation, Rancidness) impact taste but not as severely.
‚úÖ Trend Identified:
	‚Ä¢ High defect count = Low Cup Points.
	‚Ä¢ A clean cup (low defects) correlates with better quality.
‚úÖ Visualization Used:
	‚Ä¢ Stacked Column Chart to show Defect Type vs. Frequency.
	‚Ä¢ Line Chart showing Defect Count vs. Total Cup Points trend over time.
	‚Ä¢ Scatter Plot to analyze Defect Percentage vs. Quality Score.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Interaction of Variables Affecting Total Cup Points
‚úÖ Multi-Attribute Impact:
	‚Ä¢ A balance of Aroma, Acidity, and Body yields the best scores.
	‚Ä¢ An imbalance leads to inconsistent cup points.
‚úÖ Statistical Insight:
	‚Ä¢ Regression analysis shows Flavor & Aroma as the strongest predictors.
‚úÖ Visualization Used:
	‚Ä¢ Parallel Coordinates Chart for Multiple Factors & Total Cup Points.
	‚Ä¢ Radar Chart to show Sensory Attribute Contributions.
	‚Ä¢ Decomposition Tree to break down Total Cup Points by attributes.

üõ† Recommendations & Insights
‚úÖ Farmers & Producers: Focus on wet processing & defect-free beans.
‚úÖ Roasters: Blend beans with strong aroma and body for higher quality.
‚úÖ Buyers: Origin matters ‚Äì choose coffee from high-scoring regions.
